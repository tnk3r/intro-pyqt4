Introducing PyQt4

Offcial Wiki Page : https://wiki.python.org/moin/PyQt4

Standard GUI features for applications (menus, toolbars, dock windows)
Easy communication between application components (signals and slots)

A unified painting system with transparency, anti-aliasing, OpenGL integration and SVG support
Rich text processing, display and printing facilities, including support for PDF export (Qt 4.1 and later)

We will be looking at making cross platform User Interface Applications for Desktop environments. Windows, Mac, Linux.

We will go over the basic Widgets, widget configuration, Widget Styling with CSS, Overriding Widgets, and QThreads for an asynchronous User Interface.
PyQt works well on Raspberry Pi. Learn to Make User Applications for your Raspberry Pi!
